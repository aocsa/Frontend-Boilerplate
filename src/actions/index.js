// import and export your actions from this directory here
// the syntax goes like this:
// export * from './someaction';
// Afterwards you may either import named imports:
// import {myaction, hisaction, heraction} from './actions'; <- WATCH! no need to add index.js here, just the dir path
// or as:
// import * from './actions'; <- imports an object of actions, play with it, access its keys.
