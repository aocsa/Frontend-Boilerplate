// import and export your reducers from this directory here
// the syntax goes like this:
// export * from './someReducer';
// Afterwards you may either import named imports:
// import {myReducer, hisReducer, herReducer} from './reducers'; <- WATCH! no need to add index.js here, just the dir path
// or as:
// import * from './reducers'; <- imports an object of reducers, play with it, access its keys.
